This is a project in progress which was was developed with the purpose to facilitate and provide an online portal to make renting more efficient, 
benefiting both landlords and tenants. We will provide a web app in which the tenant will be charged every month using a payment method of their choosing.
With that, we will make sure the landlord gets the money on time, and can easily track which tenants have paid. 
We will send an email notification to the tenant one day before the payment is made. 
In case their payment does not go through we will notify them every day. If they do not pay the landlord will have the option to send an eviction notice. 
The expected result of the project is that the tenant will be more responsible and they will prioritise having the money to pay the monthly rent 
and we will minimise the interaction between the landlord and the tenant.
